## Thoughts on Self-Branding
The employment environment has undergone a great deal of change in the last decade or so.  No longer are the days where talented people seek positions that satisfy the sole criterion of being a "skills match."  In like fashion, savvy companies are keeping an eye out for people with proven abilities.  The reality is that workers want to find positions that allow for skills to be used in environments that allow for personal growth, realization of meaningful goals, and an understanding of impact.  In response, companies have realized the importance of creating cultures that provide a synthesis of direction, fulfillment, and financial growth.

Currently there are a wealth of resources to engage with and learn about company culture.  LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and Indeed all provide resources for job seekers to peak behind the curtain of what a position at a company is like.  Furthermore, many companies provide multiple blog posts that detail the culture, people, jobs, and future directions.  In short, there are a wealth of resources to better understand companies.  Not only that, the forums made available to job seekers allows for a fairly accurate assessment of a companies strengths and weaknesses.  Learning a companies true brand has never been earier.

### How About My Brand
The difficult reality about brands is that they don’t have as much to do with how one perceives one’s self.  Rather, brands are a conglomeration of ideas and traits that are perceived about you.  Now, some things can be controlled.  For example, I like to wear bow ties...so I do.  I have done this for years, so when I wear a bow tie, nobody bats an eyelash.  The days of “Are you going some place fancy?” or “Why are you dressed up?  It is just Tuesday.” are long gone.  My colleagues associate that particular fashion idiosyncrasy with who I am.  In that sense, I have manipulated my brand.  A portion of my brand I have less control over is how people think of my personality.  Like most everyone, I fashion myself a decent person with a dash of creativity, a sprinkle of uniqueness, a dollop of friendliness...basically all the wonderful things that make people like other people.  The question becomes: “How true is that belief?”  I have yet to meet a person that didn’t have flaws along with the good, so why would I be any different?  In fact, one of the more important things to know about yourself, especially when deciding on a career, is where your personal strengths and weaknesses lie.  What makes this ever so difficult is that we humans tend to view ourselves with rose-colored glasses.

So...how can we come up with a stylish way to present our brands to the companies that we have learned so much about and want to work for?  If these companies have let us know who they are, perhaps we should do them the favor of letting them know who we are in an interesting and personalized way.

# Who am I...Ask your Friends and Colleagues!
A word cloud is a visualization technique that allows language to be represented based on the frequency of use.  Basically, if the word is said more, it is made bigger.  A MeCloud represents the way your community views you, stylized in a way to set you apart.

## Step One
Ask 20 or so of your friends and colleagues to come up with 5 to 10 adjectives that describe you.  These can be positive or negative, but they should be a honest appraisal of you.  I recommend letting people do this via text or email...so there is no pressure.  Also, head off your snarky friends by limiting them to adjectives that make sense...being described as ‘fuchsia’ doesn’t really help anyone out.

## Step Two
Open up your browser and find a shape or image that really seems to capture a part of you.  Thanks very much to my friend Erinn...as I lamented this decision, she quickly gave me the once over and found the answer...bow tie.

## Step Three
Open up R and do yourself the favor of getting the wonderful package ‘wordcloud2’.  The package is the result of great work done by Dawei Lang.  I recommend the tutorial provided as it lets one see how versatile and fun word clouds can be.
